**Diabetes Prediction**

**Abstract**

This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling of the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset comprises of several clinical parameters of patients and presents a supervised binary classification problem i.e., predicting the onset of diabetes based on given features. The project explores data exploration, data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, outlier detection ,model building, hyperparameter tuning and evaluating various metrices.

**Introduction**

Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease. Its treatment and prevention depend on the ability to identify those who are at risk. In order to create prediction models for diabetes, this project employs machine learning algorithms on chosen dataset.

**Dataset**

The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset consists of various clinical variables such as insulin, glucoselevel. BMI, age, blood pressure, pregnancies, skin thickness diabetes pedigree function and outcome. The target variable outcome denotes the absence (0) or presence (1) of diabetes. (Pima Indians Diabetes Database)

**High-Level Architecture**

**Data preprocessing**

Dealt with the missing values through imputation and replacement techniques i.e., simple Imputer  used with median based on target variable. Categorized key features like BMI, Insulin and Glucose into meaningful categories for improved efficiency. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to address class imbalance. Standard scaler was used .

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

Along with examining the correlations between features utilizing heatmap the distributions of features by the ‘outcome’ were also visualized using density plots. A pie chart analyzed thedistribution of the target variable.

**Feature Engineering**

Mutual information for feature selection is used to identify the most impactful features. Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.A feature engineering technique was developed that presented threshold-based meaningful category classification for Glucose, Insulin and BMI levels. New categorical features(NewBMI, NewInsulinScore, NewGlucose) based on BMI, insulin levels, and glucose levels to capture non-linear relationships and enhance model interpretability.

**Optimized Model Building and Tuning**

A wide range of machine learning models were used .Different algorithms like KNeighborsClassifier,LogisticRegression,SVM,RandomForestClassifier , DecisionTreeClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier were used .To optimize model parameters like n neighbors ,C max depth , min_sampls_leaf etc. GridSearchCV was used.

**Comprehensive Model Evaluation**

Models were evaluated using multiple metrices to understand performances across different algorithms. Incorporation of visualizations provides insights into key factors driving diabetes prediction. Comparison of various models was carried out on the basis of the performance.

**Hyperparameter Considerations**

 **KNN**: 
 Tuned n_neighbors to optimize the number of neighbors used in classification.
 
 **Random Forest**:
 Ensembled model optimization is ensured through optimizing n-estimators, min_sampls_leaf ,min_samples_split and max_depth.
 
**SVM:** 
The kernel coefficient ‘gamma’ and ‘regularization parameter’ were tuned.

**Decision Tree:**
To control the trees depth and complexity min_sampls_leaf ,min_samples_split and  max_depth was optimized.

**Gradient Boosting:** 
Adjusted learning rate , n estimators , min_sampls_leaf,min_samples_split and max_depth to enhance model performance.

**Neural Network :** 
Parameters like units per layer, activation functions (e.g., sigmoid and ReLU )and learning rate were adjusted to enhance neural networks performance.Different optimizers (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) and regularization techniques were explored to mitigate overfitting.
